# Overview of the report

Homeless has been a major concern across Canada and there has been an growing need to understand the reason why people become homeless.One of the key reason of people moving to shelter homes is homelessness.In this analysis we would like to analyse whether COVID-19 has caused homeless people to move of Shelters.During the recent months there has been a decrease in occupancy rate across most of the shelters in Toronto espcially when the pandemic hit the city of Toronto.Some of the key factors that were examined for this analysis were occupancy to capacity ratio,sector and occupancy date.We found important differences in shelter home use between familiies,men and women with a noticable increase in families.There was a positive correlation between occupancy and capacity and the occupancy rate has gradually descreased over the months.A gradually decrease of chronic shelter users also indicates a serious social problem in the system that needs to be addressed
